Connect local rep to Remote rep: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/sourabhsoni94/sampleproject.git

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/sourabhsoni94/sampleproject.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sourabhsoni94/sampleproject.git (push)

origin name can be changed - so that we can push or get from any repository


git push -u origin master

git push -u : to create remote branch which is in synced with local branch ex. master  sync will happen at push and pull commands
 
pushing to cloud

--------------------------

Branching  

git branch develop   : create branch but not move to new branch
so use
git checkout -b
<name>

git checkout master : to go to master branch
 it is checking that our master branch is synced with local or not   , tracking branch 

push develop to remote rep
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>  


$ git branch -a : to see how many branch 

we take work done in develop and merge it with master
